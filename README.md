## Credits

OpenAI Realtime Blocks is inspired by other libraries like **shadcn ui**, **Aceternity**, and **MagicUI** so I want to give them credit for their work and inspiration, also I want to thank the **TailwindCSS** team for their amazing work. The UI for the site was made possible by @chonza! This library is reimplements similar components from the [VapiBlocks library](https://vapiblocks.com).
